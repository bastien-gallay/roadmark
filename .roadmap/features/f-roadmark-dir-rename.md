Rename the source directory `.roadmap/` → `.roadmark/` for brand coherence.
Deferred and low priority while usage stays personal. If ever done, ship it
non-breaking (option B): default to `.roadmark/`, fall back to `.roadmap/` with
a deprecation warning — targeted at a future v1.0, not before. `.roadmap/` is
arguably clearer and stays consistent with the `ROADMAP.md` output, so this may
never be worth the churn.
